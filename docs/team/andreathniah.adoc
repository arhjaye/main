== PROJECT: NoteNote

**NoteNote** is the go-to task management tool built for computing students to keep track of all their tasks right at their fingertips. With a minimalistic command line interface that users would be more than familiar with as computing students, NoteNote is an efficient too that allows users to analyze their productivity, categorize their tasks and many more!

This application was developed by a https://cs2113-ay1819s2-t09-3.github.io/main/AboutUs.html[team of five] as part of CS2113T, a software engineering module at National University of Singapore.

== Summary of contributions
The introduction of group tags, a feature split into two separate commands, are my main contributions to NoteNote. I also worked on enhancing the `listtag` feature and refactoring the original AddressBook into NoteNote.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to create group tags and apply them to tasks*
** What it does: allows users to create a group tag and add multiple child tags into it
** Justification: multiple tags can be repetitive to type out again and again especially if they are used often. This enhancement aims to reduce typing errors and allows a convenient way for users to easily create a group tag and apply them to different tasks.
** Highlights: This enhancement is split between `DefineTagCommand` which creates a group tag and `AddTagCommand` that applys existing group tag to a task. They should be used in conjunction.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a `listtag` command that allows the user to list down all tags and its associated task.
