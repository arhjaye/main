== PROJECT: NoteNote

---

== Overview

*NoteNote* is an effective tool for organizing multiple projects and tasks through the Command Line Interface (CLI).

Other than keeping track of your projects and tasks, NoteNote allows you to analyze your productivity, categorize your tasks, share tasks with you friends and many more.

== Summary of contributions
My contributions to NoteNote includes the introduction of an import and export feature and
the refactoring required to morph the original AddressBook application to NoteNote.

* *Enhancement 1*: added *the ability to import and export projects*
** What it does: import new projects from a JSON file and export selected projects to a JSON file
** Justification: This feature allows you to share projects with another user without having to add projects and tasks manually.
** Highlights: The implementation was challenging as it requires us to understand the implementation of the Storage component and the utilities that it relies on which we could take advantage of to implement our feature.

* *Enhancement 2*: *modified UI, Logic, Model and Storage components for NoteNote*
** What it does:
*** UI would now display an additional panel to show list of projects
*** Logic is tweaked to load project list upon start up and associate projects with their tasks to allow navigation between projects and tasks.
*** Introduce new classes in Model to support implementation of Project List, Project and Task.
*** Storage is modified to keep track of multiple tasks within a project and multiple projects within a project list
** Justification: Morphing existing AddressBook application to NoteNote.
** Highlights: Implementation was challenging as it requires us to modify all existing components simultaneously due to interlinked components.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Updated the *UI* to include a Project List Panel and Task List Panel
** Updated the *storage* to store tasks within project and project within project list
** Minor modification to *Add, Edit, Select, Delete and Clear command* to support new project list model
